## TAKE ME TO YOUR HEART

作曲 : 殷文琦

作词 : Jascha Richter

Hiding from the rain and snow

Trying to forget but I won't let go

Looking at a crowded street

Listening to my own heart beat

So many people all around the world

Tell me where do I find someone like you girl

Take me to your heart take me to your soul

Give me your hand before I'm old

Show me what love is - haven't got a clue

Show me that wonders can be true

They say nothing lasts forever

We're only here today

Love is now or never

Bring me far away

Take me to your heart take me to your soul

Give me your hand and hold me

Show me what love is - be my guiding star

It's easy take me to your heart

Standing on a mountain high

Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky

I should go and see some friends

But they don't really comprehend

Don't need too much talking without saying anything

All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing

Take me to your heart take me to your soul

Give me your hand before I'm old

Show me what love is - haven't got a clue

Show me that wonders can be true

They say nothing lasts forever

We're only here today

Love is now or never

Bring me far away

Take me to your heart take me to your soul

Give me your hand and hold me

Show me what love is - be my guiding star

It's easy take me to your heart

Take me to your heart take me to your soul

Give me your hand and hold me

Show me what love is - be my guiding star

It's easy take me to your heart

## FIVE HUNDREND MILES

If you miss the train I'm on,

You will know that I am gone,

You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles.

A hundred miles, a hundred miles,

A hundred miles, A hundred miles,

You can hear the whistle blow A hundred miles.

Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two, 

Lord,I'm three, Lord, I'm four, 

Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home.

Away from home, away from home,

away from home, away from home,

Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Not a shirt on my back,

Not a penny to my name.

Lord. I can't go back home this-a way.

This a way, this a way,

This a way, this a way,

Lord, I can't go back home this a way.

If you miss the train I'm on,

You will know that I am gone,

You can hear the whistle blow A hundred miles.

A hundred miles.

A hundred miles.

A hundred miles.

A hundred miles.

You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

## REALITY

Met you by surprise I didn't realize

That my life would change forever

Saw you standing there

I didn't know I cared,There was something special in the air

Dreams are my reality

The only kind of real fantasy

illusions are a common thing

I try to live in dreams

It seems as it's meant to be

Dreams are my reality

A different kind of reality

I dream of loving in the night

And loving seems alright

Although it's only fantasy

If you do exist 

honey don't resist

Show me a new way of loving

Tell me that it's true

show me what to do

I feel something special about you

Dreams are my reality

The only kind of reality

May be my foolishness is past

And may be now at last

I'll see how the real thing can be

Dreams are my reality

A wondrous world where I like to be

I dream of holding you all night and holding you seems right

Perhaps that's my reality

Met you by surprise I didn't realize

That'my love would change forever

Tell me that it's true, feeling that are new

I feel something special about you

Dreams are my reality

A wonderous world where I like to be

Illusions are a common thing

I try to live in dreams

Although it's only fantasy

Dreams are my reality

I like to dream of you close to me

I dream of loving in the night

And loving you seems right

Perhaps that's my reality
