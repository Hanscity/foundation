TEST(1)                          User Commands                         TEST(1)

NAME
       test - check file types and compare values

SYNOPSIS
       test EXPRESSION
       test

       [ EXPRESSION ]
       [ ]
       [ OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Exit with the status determined by EXPRESSION.
       决定于表达式的状态而停止。

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       An  omitted EXPRESSION defaults to false.  Otherwise, EXPRESSION is true or false and
       sets exit status.  It is one of:

       一个省略的表达式默认为假。否则，表达式为真，或者为假并设置退出状态。示例如下：

       ( EXPRESSION )
              EXPRESSION is true

       ! EXPRESSION
              EXPRESSION is false

       EXPRESSION1 -a EXPRESSION2
              both EXPRESSION1 and EXPRESSION2 are true

       EXPRESSION1 -o EXPRESSION2
              either EXPRESSION1 or EXPRESSION2 is true

       -n STRING
              the length of STRING is nonzero

       STRING equivalent to -n STRING

       -z STRING
              the length of STRING is zero

       STRING1 = STRING2
              the strings are equal
       STRING1 != STRING2
              the strings are not equal

       INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is equal to INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 -ge INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is greater than or equal to INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is greater than INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 -le INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is less than or equal to INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 -lt INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is less than INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 -ne INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is not equal to INTEGER2

       FILE1 -ef FILE2
              FILE1 and FILE2 have the same device and inode numbers

       FILE1 -nt FILE2
              FILE1 is newer (modification date) than FILE2

       FILE1 -ot FILE2
              FILE1 is older than FILE2

       -b FILE
              FILE exists and is block special

       -c FILE
              FILE exists and is character special
              文件存在，并且是特殊字符。
              注释：crw-rw-rw-. 1 root tty 5, 0 11月 14 01:10 /dev/tty

       -d FILE
              FILE exists and is a directory

       -e FILE
              FILE exists

       -f FILE
              FILE exists and is a regular file
       -g FILE
              FILE exists and is set-group-ID

       -G FILE
              FILE exists and is owned by the effective group ID

       -h FILE
              FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as -L)

       -k FILE
              FILE exists and has its sticky bit set

       -L FILE
              FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as -h)

       -O FILE
              FILE exists and is owned by the effective user ID

       -p FILE
              FILE exists and is a named pipe
              文件存在并且命名为管道

       -r FILE
              FILE exists and read permission is granted
              文件存在并且有读的权限
       -s FILE
              FILE exists and has a size greater than zero

       -S FILE
              FILE exists and is a socket

       -t FD  file descriptor FD is opened on a terminal

       -u FILE
              FILE exists and its set-user-ID bit is set

       -w FILE
              FILE exists and write permission is granted

       -x FILE
              FILE exists and execute (or search) permission is granted

       Except for -h and -L, all FILE-related tests dereference symbolic links.  Beware that
       parentheses  need  to be escaped (e.g., by backslashes) for shells.  INTEGER may also
       be -l STRING, which evaluates to the length of STRING.

       NOTE: [ honors the --help and --version options, but test does not.  test treats each
       of those as it treats any other nonempty STRING.

       NOTE:  your shell may have its own version of test and/or [, which usually supersedes
       the version described here.  Please refer to your shell’s documentation  for  details
       about the options it supports.

       除开 -h 和 -L 选项，所有的文件关联测试都解除了符号链接。注意圆括号需要转义，比如使用反斜杠，
       在 shell 中。整型或许也用到了 -l 等字符型的选项，会当做字符串的长度来计算。

       注意：[ 遵守 --help 和 --version 选项，但是 test 不需要。test 对待它们中的每一个，就像对待
       其他非空的字符串一样。

       注意：你的 shell 或许有它自己的 test 和 /or 或者是 [ 版本,这通常会替换掉在此说明的版本。请
       查看你的 shell 的详细说明关于它所支持的选项。
